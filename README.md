# PoW Market

> A market for magic numbers

## Getting Started

To get the PoW market running, use the following commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/synfonaut/pow.market.git
cd pow.market
npm i
npm start


(in a new shell)
npm run state_machine
```

Depends on MongoDB but could easily be switched out for another database. Pull requests welcome!
